PREDICTION OF A RETAIL SHOP BASED ON FEW SPECIFICATIONS

PROBLEM :
  THE AIM OF THE PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE SALES OF THE RETAIL SHOP BASED ON THE MARKDOWNS, CONSUMER PRICE INDEX, TEMPERATURE, SIZE OF THE BUILDING AND OTHER FEW FACTORS.

  The goals is to create a model that can predict the sales of the store based on the consumer choices. It helps in the sales and improve the other aspects that the consumer is looking for. So these apply in the profit of the company and as well as it serves better for its consumer, and achieve profit more than the target set.

  STEPS TO BE NOTED:
   1. DATA COLLECTION :
        Gather the data that has been provided and see that the data that is available for the predictions.

        Looking out for the accuracy and consistency across the store and CPI.

    2. MODEL SELECTION : 
        Choose the suitable ML and optimize the prediction accuracy is more time consuming and tireing job. Moving to the deployment of the predictions to the 
       real-time environment.

    3. Once the  model is selected create the train and test data, also see the mean, median and square values of the data. Also check the hyper tuning method, see how the data is getting affected in the values. Based on which you will see which will be more effective in the predictions.

    4. Create a EDA, where we get to compare the data and see visually how it affects the decisions.
